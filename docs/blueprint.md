## Style Guidelines:

- Dark background (#121212) to provide contrast and a modern feel.
- A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) for accents and highlights, providing a visually appealing contrast against the dark background. The blue will provide a high tech feel.
- A darker, analogous blue (#29506D) for interactive elements and call-to-actions. Use sparingly for important elements like buttons and links.
- 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a computerized, techy feel, particularly well-suited for headlines.
- 'Inter' (sans-serif) will pair well with 'Space Grotesk'; 'Inter' is a neutral, modern font that ensures readability for all text, including paragraphs.
- Use simple, clean icons for contact information and navigation. Use the FontAwesome or Material Icons library for consistency and scalability.
- Implement a fixed top navigation bar for easy access to different sections. Use a single-page layout with smooth scrolling to improve user experience.
- Use subtle scroll-triggered animations, such as fade-in or slide-in effects, to create a smooth and engaging user experience.
